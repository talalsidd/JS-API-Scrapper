How to scrape data from a site using POST requests in Chrome console
First you need to get the API URL from the website . Here is a sample Graphql API url from zillow 'https://www.zillow.com/search/GetSearchPageState.htm?searchQueryState=%7B%22pagination%22%3A%7B%22currentPage%22%3A2%7D%2C%22usersSearchTerm%22%3A%22CA%22%2C%22mapBounds%22%3A%7B%22west%22%3A-153.847663625%2C%22east%22%3A-84.765632375%2C%22south%22%3A27.621171317999984%2C%22north%22%3A46.085364881491216%7D%2C%22regionSelection%22%3A%5B%7B%22regionId%22%3A9%2C%22regionType%22%3A2%7D%5D%2C%22isMapVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22filterState%22%3A%7B%22doz%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3A%221%22%7D%2C%22isAllHomes%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22isCondo%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22isMultiFamily%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22isManufactured%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22isLotLand%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22isTownhouse%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22isApartment%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%22isApartmentOrCondo%22%3A%7B%22value%22%3Afalse%7D%7D%2C%22isListVisible%22%3Atrue%2C%22mapZoom%22%3A4%7D&wants={%22cat1%22:[%22listResults%22,%22mapResults%22],%22cat2%22:[%22total%22]}&requestId=4'
After that you need to add URLs to the array 'window.allurls' and execute the listpage script. You need to update the headers in 'window.alldata' array by yourself.
